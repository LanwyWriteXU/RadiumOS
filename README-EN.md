Click [here](https://lanwywritexu.github.io/RadiumOS/webos/lasted ) to access the **online version of RadiumOS**.

RadiumOS is a **WebOS** project based on Scratch, open-sourced to help other Scratchers create their own ScratchOS.

> When people assume your ScratchOS is a Linux distribution, you've reached the pinnacle of human achievement. (Mistium)

If you have the capability, you can use it as a frontend to connect to the system via Node.js and perform some system operations; however, doing so seems to be pointless.

You can create a simple ScratchOS by downloading the old version source code from `RadiumOS/src/Original Edition`, but development of the original version has been discontinued. Alternatively, you can download the remastered version source code from `RadiumOS/src/Remastered Edition` to create a more advanced and feature-rich ScratchOS. You can deploy it to GitHub Pages using TurboWarp Packager.
