RadiumOS is a WebOS project developed based on Scratch. It is open-sourced to help other Scratchers create their own ScratchOS.

> When people assume your scratchOS is a linux distro is when you have reached the peak of human accomplishment.(Mistium)
> (Note: Mistium is the developer of [originOS](https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS), which is an interpreter that allows you to create applications by writing OSL.)

If you have the capability, you can use it as a front-end to connect to a system via Node.js and perform some system operations. However, doing so seems to have no real significance.

> This project is for learning and entertainment purposes only and does not involve any infringement. You are free to modify it, distribute it, or even sell it. I will not be held responsible for any subsequent actions, as long as you credit me as the original creator.

You can download the source code from `RadiumOS/src/Original Edition` to create a simple ScratchOS, but the original version has been discontinued. Alternatively, you can download the source code from `RadiumOS/src/Reloaded Edition` to create a more advanced and feature-rich ScratchOS. You can then deploy it to GitHub Pages using TurboWarp Packager. I am not sure if this project meets your needs, but I will continue to maintain it out of passion.
