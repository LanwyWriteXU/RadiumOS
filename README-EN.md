RadiumOS is a **WebOS** project based on Scratch, which is open-sourced to help other Scratchers create their own ScratchOS.

> When people assume your ScratchOS is a Linux distribution, you have reached the pinnacle of human achievement. (Mistium)  
> (Note: Mistium is the developer of [originOS](https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS ), an interpreter that allows you to create applications by writing OSL.)

If you have the capability, you can use it as a frontend to connect to the system via Node.js and perform some system operations. However, doing so seems to be pointless.

You can create a simple ScratchOS by downloading the old version source code from `RadiumOS/src/Original Edition`, but development of the original version has been discontinued. Alternatively, you can download the remastered version source code from `RadiumOS/src/Remastered Edition` to create a more advanced and feature-rich ScratchOS. You can deploy it to GitHub Pages using TurboWarp Packager.

## History

Around 2021, the prototype of RadiumOS, " **ZIUI**," was developed but was discontinued after six months. In 2024, development of **RadiumOS** resumed, but in October 2024, I felt that RadiumOS was too complicated, so I stopped development again. In the same month, I started working on **RadiumOS R-E**. Now, they are all here.

## Plans

- [ ] Develop RTaDOS (Radium Terminal and Disk Operating System)
    - [x] Prepare Radium account service
- [ ] New user interface for RadiumOS R-E
- [ ] Online update functionality
- [ ] Settings, music, and other applications
- [ ] **Super amazing plan**: Develop a RadiumScript interpreter
