A0.1.0
First Alpha release with basic ICONS and Windows and taskbars.
 
A0.1. X
* UI updates *
The X in this version number refers to the level 3 version number, and there are no major updates to either version of A0.1, so they are collectively referred to as A0.1.x.
In A0.1.X, my main task is to develop the basic functions of the system, such as multi-windows. As it happens, I did build a smooth engine. It's silky and beautiful.
But I must also continue to simplify enrichment and system software before opening up software development.
If you want to develop software for this OS, stay tuned for future updates!
